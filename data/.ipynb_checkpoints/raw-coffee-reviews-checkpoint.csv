With its generally elongated beans and distinctive floral and crisp, often chocolaty cup, the Gesha variety continues to distinguish itself as one of the world’s most unique coffees. Although the Gesha variety originated in Ethiopia, it was “discovered” by the coffee world in 2004 growing in Boquete, Panama, and Panama continues to dominate the expanding world of Gesha. This particular version, however, is the outcome of efforts to commercialize Gesha in the region from which it originally came. It was processed by the natural method (dried in the whole fruit).

Flavor-saturated finish that sustains each note from the cup in long, ringing clarity. ","Coffee from trees of the botanical variety Geisha (also Gesha) grown on Price Peterson’s Hacienda La Esmeralda in Panama first introduced this extraordinary variety of Arabica to the world. With its bold, boat-shaped beans and distinctive floral and crisply cacao-toned cup, the Gesha continues one of the world’s most unique coffees, and the Esmeralda versions remain among the most authentic.

","This coffee tied for the fourth-highest rating in a cupping of coffees of the Geisha/Gesha variety of Arabica for Coffee Review’s September 2019 tasting report. The celebrated Geisha (also spelled Gesha) variety of Arabica first came to the coffee world’s attention growing in Panama. This particular version, however, is the outcome of efforts to commercialize Geisha in the region from which it originally came. It was grown in western Ethiopia by farmers Adam and Rachel Overton and their indigenous Meanit culture collaborators from seed selected from wild trees of the Geisha variety in the nearby Gori Gesha forest. It is a wet-processed or washed coffee, in which the skin and pulp of the fruit is removed before the coffee is dried, encouraging here a particularly floral cup.

With its generally elongated beans and distinctive floral and crisp, often chocolaty cup, the Gesha variety of Arabica continues to distinguish itself as one of the world’s rarest and most unique coffees.

This particular version, however, is the outcome of efforts to commercialize Gesha in the region from which it originally came.
